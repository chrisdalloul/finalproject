			<h3>Basic Info</h3>
			<p>The case is the case for your components. Funny, but it can be easily over read and bought for just aesthetical purposes. When the case holds your parts, it also holds much more. It holds the hot air that your parts exhaust. It holds the noise that your fans will create. Your case holds the dust. It also holds the most important part about your computer, your components. If your case does not have adequate cooling capabilities, you are severely cutting your computer&#39;s life, by your cards overheating. If it does not have sound-silencing walls, then you&#39;re essentially running a loud generator. If it does not have dust filters, then your build a blanket to store the heat in your computer. And if your case is faulty, then your entire system can collapse at any minute. Choosing the right case is a mix of all these elements, but also is your own flair. Like simplicicity? Choose a Fractal R4. More of a complicated person? Go for the CoolerMaster Storm Trooper. The choices are almost unlimited, but are entirely up to you.</p>
