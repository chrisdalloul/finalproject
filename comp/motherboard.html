			<h3>Basic Info</h3>
			<p>The motherboard is like a large amount of wires flattened onto a board, and small useful chips are added. It connects the major parts, the CPU, your HDD/SSD, the graphics card(s), your power supply, and more, but it also adds cool essential stuff like an internet chip, and usually onboard audio chips. It is easily the most underrated part of the computer, as most think of it as just an outlet for their other parts. It is also essential when choosing a motherboard to have a CPU slot that can accommodate the CPU, for example AMD CPU&#39;s outlets are much different than Intel&#39;s CPU&#39;s, so an AMD CPU will not work on a board built to accommodate an Intel one. Also the motherboard BIOS is your backup “OS” If anything goes wrong, so choosing one with a user-friendly BIOS is optimal. Overclocking is only limited to your motherboard capabilities as well. </p>
