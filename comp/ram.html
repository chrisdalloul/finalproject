			<h3>Basic Info</h3>
			<p>RAM stands for random access memory, and is where your computer stores your temporary files. For example, if you&#39;re playing a game, your pc would store the game on the RAM because sifting through the RAM for a file is much faster than sifting through a hard drive or SSD. DDR5 RAM is faster than DDR3. RAM&#39;s speed is also measured in MHz, with the more the better. CAS latency is used to test the “slowness” of your RAM, so picking modules with low CAS is better. </p>

			<h3>Deciding the amount of RAM</h3>
			<p>If your desktop is going to be used for gaming, then getting anything over 8 Gb is simply unneeded , but if you use or think you will use editing software of any kind, or any program that is very large, then you will benefit from a higher amount of RAM. By storing files on RAM, the program will run much, much faster than sifting through the hard drive. </p>
