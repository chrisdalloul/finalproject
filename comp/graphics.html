			<h3>Basic Info</h3>
			<p>The Graphics card is sort of like a mini motherboard package in one. It holds a GPU, or graphics processing unit, and a fan specifically designed to cool it. Graphics cards are specifically designed for optimizing a user&#39;s experience visually. Modern day programs are putting more and more pressure on graphics cards as they have become many times more powerful, which only stresses the importance of a strong graphics card. The two main competitors in nVidia and AMD, which is also present in the CPU market.  The most basic part of choosing a graphics card is choosing the cooler. It is almost never recommended to buy a nVidia from nVidia, it is always the best to buy a card from a company that has added their own cooler and fans. When you buy a non-stock card you usually pay the extra price for the boost in cooling that the fans offer. </p>

			<h3>nVidia Graphics Cards</h3>
			<p>nVidia graphics cards have a high reputation for performance, yet tend to be costly. nVidia cards have pioneered the 3D graphics world, so if you&#39;re looking for that, choose a nVidia card rather than an AMD. nVidia cards also feature PhysX, a tool for beautiful and seamless physics in modern games that use it to their full advantage. Modern games such as Borderlands 2, and Battlefield 3 are optimized to run PhysX.  </p>

			<h3>AMD Graphics Cards</h3>
			<p>AMD graphics cards have an extremely good price/performance ratio. Up to the price of around 350$, choosing an AMD video card is the right way to go. Their graphics drivers in the 7XXX series dominate nVidia cards at that level. AMD cards are very good at allowing overclockers new options to push out an amazing amount of performance. However research before even trying to overclock, overclocking can easily ruin your rig if done wrong. </p>
