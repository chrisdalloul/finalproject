			<h3>Basic Info</h3>
			<p>The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the brains of the computer. It is also referred as the processor. The CPU performs lots of calculations, really fast, thus causing it to heat up so it needs a fan just for itself! Everything that you see on a computer has gone through the CPU, imagine it as a bridge. CPU&#39;s are constantly being replaced by newer and better versions, and often times even new bridges (a bridge is referred to the connection between the motherboard and CPU) are made to maximize a CPU&#39;s performance. When choosing a CPU, look at the number of cores, the Ghz (speed the CPU runs at), and whether it is overclockable or not. To overclock a CPU is to make it run more calculations than the manufacturer recommends, which is alright as long as you have the proper cooling system for it. </p>

			<h3>Intel CPU&#39;s</h3>
			<p>Intel CPU&#39;s have a reputation of power, especially for their non-outrageous prices. For tasks such as gaming, Intel CPU&#39;s are much better to get than AMD&#39;s current offerings. Intel&#39;s chips have a higher price when being compared to AMD, but their price is payed by frames per second in their games, editing software, or other programs that are CPU intensive. </p>
