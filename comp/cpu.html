			<h3>Basic Info</h3>
			<p>The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the brains of the computer. It is also referred as the processor. The CPU performs lots of calculations, really fast, thus causing it to heat up so it needs a fan just for itself! Everything that you see on a computer has gone through the CPU, imagine it as a bridge. CPU&#39;s are constantly being replaced by newer and better versions, and often times even new bridges (a bridge is referred to the connection between the motherboard and CPU) are made to maximize a CPU&#39;s performance. When choosing a CPU, look at the number of cores, the Ghz (speed the CPU runs at), and whether it is overclockable or not. To overclock a CPU is to make it run more calculations than the manufacturer recommends, which is alright as long as you have the proper cooling system for it. </p>

			<h3>Intel CPU&#39;s</h3>
			<p>Intel CPU&#39;s have a reputation of power, especially for their non-outrageous prices. For tasks such as gaming, Intel CPU&#39;s are much better to get than AMD&#39;s current offerings. Intel&#39;s chips have a higher price when being compared to AMD, but their price is payed by frames per second in their games, editing software, or other programs that are CPU intensive. </p>

		<section class="amd">
			<h3>AMD CPU&#39;s</h3>
			<p>AMD CPU&#39;s are renowned for their cheap price/performance ratio. They make very high quality cheap processors, and amazing expensive cards that will destroy anything you throw at it for years to come. By choosing AMD, you choose price over performance, but make sure to buy an AMD-compatible motherboard!</p>

			<h3>Aftermarket CPU Coolers</h3>
			<p>Aftermarket CPU coolers are CPU fans, whether water cooling or not, that you buy separately from your CPU purchase. These fans perform much better than the stock fans that come with Intel and AMD products. By purchasing an aftermarket CPU cooler you allow the room for overclocking, so in years to come when your CPU will struggle with the modern games, simply overclock it and your fan will do the dirty work. Know your limit when overclocking though, great external links are in the footer. </p>
