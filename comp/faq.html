			<h3>Why should I build a computer rather than simply buy a prebuilt one?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Many people choose building a computer because simply it will save you money. Building a computer reduces all of the ridiculous fees built into the prebuilt prices to none. </li>
				<li>Building a computer allows you to pick the parts for your needs. Not a “one-size-fits-all” kind of deal. Focusing on gaming? Pick a good graphics card. Looking to store a lot of data? Simply put more of your budget into your storage</li>
				<li>Prebuilt computers are notorious for pre-installing bloatware onto your pc, thus slowing it down. It could take several hours to remove all of the bloatware, and in those hours even a novice could build a computer. </li>
				<li>Warranties for individual products last much longer than one that comes with a prebuilt system. </li>
				<li>Building a computer is a great experience,and allows you to learn quite a bit of knowledge about computers</li>

			<h3>Deciding the amount of RAM</h3>
			<p>If your desktop is going to be used for gaming, then getting anything over 8 Gb is simply unneeded , but if you use or think you will use editing software of any kind, or any program that is very large, then you will benefit from a higher amount of RAM. By storing files on RAM, the program will run much, much faster than sifting through the hard drive. </p>
