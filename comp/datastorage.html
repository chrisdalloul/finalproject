			<h3>Basic Info</h3>
			<p>Hard drives and SSD&#39;s, or solid state drives, are used to store data. Hard drive essentially runs on disks, like extremely advanced smaller and heavier CD&#39;s. A hard drive&#39;s speed is measured in RPM (Rotations per minute), which basically states how fast the disk spins. If it rotates faster, then the disk will read it faster. Storage these days are common in Terabytes, or 1000 Gb, which 20 years ago was thought impossible to obtain. Personally, I recommend getting over 1 Tb, unless you love spending your time uninstalling old programs. </p>

			<h3>SSD&#39;s</h3>
			<p>Solid state drives are an extremely new piece of technology, and work by magic from only Gandalf himself. These boys run so fast they&#39;re 7 to 8 times more expensive than hard drives, but are worth it. Putting an OS on it, and a couple of your favorite programs that you access commonly will decrease your wait time by a lot. </p>
